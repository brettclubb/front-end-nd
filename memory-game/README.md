## Game

The goal of the game is to pair together all of the matching cards.

To get started, click a card to turn it over.  Once shown, select another card you think could be a match. Showing a pair of cards is considered one move.

If the cards match, they will change color and stay on the screen.  If not, the cards will flip back over, remaining in the same position.

Continue attempting to match the cards until all matches are found.

## Dependencies

* [Font Awesome]("https://fontawesome.com/")
* [Google Fonts]("https://fonts.google.com/")

Font Awesome is a font library used to display the icons on the cards within the game.  

Google Fonts is used for styling the text within the game.

Both libraries are loaded from a CDN and therefore require an internet connection on initial load to display the game properly.
